# What is Tenzi Dice Game
The world’s fastest game! Everyone gets ten dice. Someone says, “Go.” Then everyone rolls and rolls as fast as they can until someone gets all their dice on the same number and shouts “TENZI.”

## About This Repo
I coded this game through a tutorial on Scrimba (learn react) and added some new features to it:
- To put real dots on the dice so that a user can change the faces by the dropdown menu using **CSS**;
- To track the number of rolls after a user starts rolling and to display it
- To track the time it took to win and display it after the game ends
- To add a switch to change UI mode between Light and Dark using **conditional style**
